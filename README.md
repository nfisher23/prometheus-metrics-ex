# prometheus-metrics-ex
Some sample code that should get you going on configuring a spring boot application to expose prometheus metrics, 
then a bare-bones introduction on how one might operationalize the ingestion of those metrics.

## blog posts

This code is meant to accompany two tutorials:

1. [How to Expose Meaningful Prometheus Metrics In a Spring Boot 2.x Application](https://nickolasfisher.com/blog/How-to-Expose-Meaningful-Prometheus-Metrics-In-a-Spring-Boot-2x-Application)
2. [How to Configure Prometheus to Scrape and Aggregate Data From a Spring Boot 2.x Application](https://nickolasfisher.com/blog/How-to-Configure-Prometheus-to-Scrape-and-Aggregate-Data-From-a-Spring-Boot-2x-Application)

Have fun observing stuff.
